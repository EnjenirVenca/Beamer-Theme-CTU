The research paper is based on a questionnaire survey obtained from the 91 companies. This paper is one of the few studies which investigate the relationship between management tools and techniques and organizational performance. The findings show the level of management tools utilization and possibilities influencing performance. The study indicates that there is a positive significant relationship between management tools and techniques utilization and organizational performance.},

  abstract = {All businesses have many issues, especially small and medium enterprises trying to survive with traditional technology. Therefore, enterprises need to adopt business intelligence by using the management of information technology systems to overcome the issues. This study proposes a conceptual framework that identifies the potential factors that influence the adoption of business intelligence systems in the SME industry in Libya. Therefore, this study was established based on two main theories: the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the unified theory of adopting and using technology (UTAUT). In line with the previous studies that investigated this type of influence, this study recommended a conceptual framework containing several factors: change management, knowledge sharing, information quality, IT project management, the perceived usefulness of a BIS, and the perceived ease of adoption of a BIS. This study did not consider the environmental factors’ effect on adopting a BIS (business intelligence system); this is due to the different characteristics of each small and medium enterprise in terms of the sector or industry type.},

Goal of the paper is to discuss a framework for investigating the adoption of business intelligence systems in companies, from the technology acceptance model perspective.

Based on the framework, we propose a model with research propositions and discuss scientific contributions.},

  abstract = {Business intelligence systems (BISs) refer to a wide range of technologies and applications useful for retrieving and analyzing a large amount of information with the goal to generate knowledge useful for making effective business decision. In order to investigate adoption of BISs in companies, we propose a model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) that is expanded by variables representing the concept of a project management maturity (PMM). The survey on the sample of USA companies has been conducted with the chief information officer (CIO) as the main informant. A structural equation model has been developed in order to test the research model. Results indicate that TAM expanded with the notion of PMM is useful in increasing understanding of BISs adoption in companies.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses a recurrent topic of organizational project management (OPM) research: Project Management Offices (PMOs) are perceived to be instrumental in implementing strategy through portfolios of projects, but empirical evidence also shows that PMOs are often short-lived and their value is hard to quantify. We argue that an explanation may lie in the processes of co-evolution that PMOs undergo over time in interaction with organizational capabilities and context. We adopt an innovative research frame in the context of OPM research, using process theories of change and routines as a lens to investigate the co-evolution of PMO and Portfolio Management. A conceptual framework is suggested and we use an empirical case study to test and refine it. We discuss the theoretical implications of the findings and highlight the contributions made in supporting, adding, articulating and contrasting extant literature. We conclude the paper underlining paths for further researches.},
